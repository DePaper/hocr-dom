## hocr-dom

The main package, contains code for querying hOCR elements and parsing / accesing properties.

See the [README](./hocr-dom/README.md) for API docs.

In short, in the browser, you will only need

```js
HocrDOM.extendPrototypes(window)
```

After this, you can use `document.queryHocrAll` on document and elements, as
well as access properties via their `hocr` property.

## hocr-dom-jsdom

Contains a browser-independent HTML parser with built-in hOCR support, thanks
to [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).
